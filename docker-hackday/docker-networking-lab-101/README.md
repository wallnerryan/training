The Docker Bridge & Veth Pairs
==============================

Docker uses a virtaual ethernet bridge to manage networking between container on 
a single host called ```docker0```. upon startup docker will randomly choose a 
subnet from the private range defined in RFC 1918 that are not used on the host machine. 
The docker bridge subnet may have the address similar to ```172.17.42.1/16``` which
gives the host 65,534 possible container ip addresses. the ".1" address
will be the gateway for the containers.

```ifconfig | grep -A 7 docker0```

There are various options to change the docker bridge and general docker networking,
 we will not cover them in detail here but the options include:
- -b or --bridge=BRIDGE (Build your own bridge)
- --bip=CIDR (Give the docker bridge your own CIDR address)
- --fixed-cidr (Limit address range)
- -H SOCKET --host=SOCKET (Tell the server to listen on)
- --icc=true|false (Enable/Disable communication between containers)
- --ip=IPADDRESS (Port forwards go to a single address, instead of 0.0.0.0)
- --ip-forward=true|false
- --iptables=true|false
- --mtu=BYTES

###### The docker-engine process
```
$ps ax | grep "docker -d"
1293 root     /usr/local/bin/docker -d -D -g /var/lib/docker -H unix:// -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2376 --tlsverify --tlscacert=/var/lib/boot2docker/tls/ca.pem --tlscert=/var/lib/boot2docker/tls/server.pem --tlskey=/var/lib/boot2docker/tls/serverkey.pem
```

###### NAT
See what forwarding rules exists on your Docker-host

```sudo iptables -t nat -L -n```

###### V-Eth Pairs
Every time Docker creates a container, it creates a pair of peer interfaces that are
like opposite ends of a pipe (i.e., a packet sent on one will be received on the
other). It gives one of the peers to the container to become its eth0 interface and
keeps the other peer, with a unique name like vethec6a, out on the host machine. Consider
one end to be "plugged" into the container and the other into the docker0 bridge.

###### See your veths
```
ifconfig | grep veth
veth4ea42c9 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 2A:39:65:D0:0F:CB
vethd8887a8 Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr BA:A7:38:FB:AF:0F
```

Networking Modes
================

Docker allows containers to change some networking properties during runtime. This allows certain networking features to be enabled or changed for individual containers.

```
--net="bridge"   Set the Network mode for the container
                 'bridge': creates a new network stack for the container on the docker bridge
                 'none': no networking for this container
                 'container:<name|id>': reuses another container network stack
                 'host': use the host network stack inside the container.  Note: the host mode gives the container full access to local system services such as D-bus and is therefore considered insecure.
```

In this lab, we will stick to using "bridge" to provide the containers a local subnet.

Containers and IP Addresses
===========================

All containers will get an IP address when deployed when they use the default docker bridge. Lets test this out, lets deploy a simple web application.

```
sudo docker run -rm -it ubuntu /bin/bash
```

(you may need to **apt-get install net-tools** )
```
69163446b74b:/# ifconfig
eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 02:42:0a:00:00:16
          inet addr:172.17.0.7  Bcast:0.0.0.0  Mask:255.255.255.0
          inet6 addr: fe80::42:aff:fe00:16/64 Scope:Link

          RX bytes:936 (936.0 B)  TX bytes:468 (468.0 B)

          inet addr:127.0.0.1  Mask:255.0.0.0
          inet6 addr: ::1/128 Scope:Host
          UP LOOPBACK RUNNING  MTU:65536  Metric:1
          RX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0

          collisions:0 txqueuelen:0
          RX bytes:0 (0.0 B)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 B)
```

Or from outside of the container.
```
sudo docker inspect -f '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <name>
172.17.0.7
```

Without any networking
```
docker run -rm -it -P --net=none ubuntu /bin/bash
Warning: '-rm' is deprecated, it will be replaced by '--rm' soon. See usage.
root@a5d337f58977:/# ip link

```

With host networking
```
docker run -rm -it -P --net=host ubuntu:13.10 /bin/bash
Warning: '-rm' is deprecated, it will be replaced by '--rm' soon. See usage.

```

How to Manage Ports
===================
Docker exposes port managment in two main ways, via the Dockerfile and during runtime.

###### Dockerfile
Dockerfile's use ```EXPOSE``` instructions informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified network ports at runtime. Docker uses this information to interconnect containers using links (We'll cover this later). The ```EXPOSE``` instruction allows ports to be exposed in the app, but not to the host, we need to use ```-p``` at runtime for this.

Lets build a simple application with ```EXPOSE```
```
# Version: 0.0.1
FROM ubuntu:14.04
MAINTAINER First Last â€œemail@example.com"
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nginx
RUN echo 'Hi, I am in your container' \
>/usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
EXPOSE 80
RUN echo "daemon off;" >> /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
CMD ["nginx"]
```

###### Runtime
```
docker build -t expose_demo .
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name expose8080 expose_demo

visit: http://<boot2dockervm>:8080
```

###### The different between ```-p``` and ```-P```
With ```-p``` you much set ```[ip]:<host-port>:<container-port>[/type]``` and with ```-P``` docker will choose a random port for the ports that you have using ```EXPOSE```

```-p``` gives us the flexibility of different schemas:
- 5000:5000
- 127.0.0.1:5000:5000
- 127.0.0.1:5000:5000/udp

###### Retrieve a bound port with using -P on a specific container.
```
docker port <name>
```


How to Link Containers
======================

Containers do not always have to use IP-based ways to communicate, docker has another flag called ```--link``` that allows a way for containers to share data, environment variables, and other resources without tieing IP-based address together.
```
--link name:alias
```

How to Create Services Between Containers using ```--link```
=============================================================

```
(Run our docker image that exposed port 80 from before)
docker run -it -rm --name mycontainter 3b13d0f99031 /bin/bash

(Link web with db using --link)
docker run -it -P --name web --link mycontainer:mycontainer ubuntu /bin/bash

$env

$cat /etc/hosts
$ping mycontainer
```

A Real Example
```
docker run -d --name db training/postgres

docker run -d -P --name web --link db:db training/webapp python app.py

docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                      COMMAND                CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                     NAMES
7343f3c9d585        training/webapp:latest     "python app.py"        2 seconds ago       Up 1 seconds        0.0.0.0:49156->5000/tcp   web
416d1aee9835        training/postgres:latest   "su postgres -c '/us   11 seconds ago      Up 10 seconds       5432/tcp                  db
```

What's actually happening is Docker creates a secure tunnel between the containers that doesn't need to expose any ports externally on the container; For instance, we did not need to expose the postgress port externally on the ``db`` container for it to communicate with web. Docker uses environment variables and the /etc/hosts file for expose information.
